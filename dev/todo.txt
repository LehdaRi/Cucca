TODO:

Find more ways to break the resource system
	multiple resource managers
		-> Task / ThreadPool flagging system will cause havoc (removal of all Tasks originated from any manager)
			possible fixes?
				store a void pointer to creator object to Task (kinda hack)

ResourceManager
	! thread safety
		handling data structures when destructing(res. infos espec.[shared pointer])
	(lo-prio) make smarter destructor (multithreaded, skip destruction of destructed resources[add removeDestructedResources member function perhaps?])
	make graphics resource initialization pipeline (Device, Resource)
	make buffer for unreferenced resources and implement lazy uninitialization

Resource
	! add conditional variable notification when the initialization is done
	
Check thread safety
	ResourcePointers / ResourceManager
	nodes/components/visitors?
