TODO:

(Put template definitions in .inl files[see google style guide!]) and unify the layout

Start implementing graphics components
	Shaders
	Meshes
	Materials
	Curves, animations
	etc.

Rethink role of the Device
Rethink role of the TaskQueue (can be generalized? TBB replacement?)

Add comments and documentation

Renaming of CoreExtensions?
	CoreInterface perhaps?

Check thread safety
	ResourcePointers / (ResourceManager)
	nodes/components/visitors?

ResourceManager:
	! thread safety
		handling data structures when destructing(res. infos espec.[shared pointer])
	~ make smarter destructor (multithreaded, skip destruction of destructed resources[add removeDestructedResources member function perhaps?])
	~ fix double copying when passing arguments to Resource::init (forward/move diipadaapa)
	make buffer for unreferenced resources and implement lazy uninitialization

Find more ways to break the resource system
	multiple resource managers
		-> Task / ThreadPool flagging system will cause havoc (removal of all Tasks originated from any manager)
			possible fixes?
				store a void pointer to creator object to Task (kinda hack?)

Proper exceptions and exception handling

Rethink unit test system

Device:
	Implement chrono timer so that fps won't drop when there is too much graphics tasks in the queue
